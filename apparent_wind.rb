# ApparentWind's primary behavior is to evaluate the apparent wind angle given the real
# wind angle and the wind velocity. This is needed in order to evaluate {Boat#velocity}.
#
# It uses an equation given by Yoav Raz in his paper:
#
# "Sailboat Speed vs. Wind Speed â€“ predicting sailboat's speed at a given wind"
